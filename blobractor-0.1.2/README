Most of this file needs to be updated to the blobractor
system.


-------------------------------------------------------
Basic procedure for exporting all images from 
all videos.
-------------------------------------------------------
1.  - Go to $HOME/bin/stractor2_d/example_setup, and 
      copy the file 
        aa
        stractor.config
      to your working directory.
2.  - Alter the config file so that !indir gives the 
      path to the SAVA folder containing the 
        Video yyyymmdd hhmmss
      folders.
3.  - If needed, alter it to have !oudir point to a 
      different location to place exported images.
4.  - Do
        ./aa
5.  - stractor2 with create a dirlist.  It will be 
      called stractor2-dir.list if the config file
      isn't changed.
6.  - stractor2 will then create a v### folder for
      each video in the oudir folder and export 
      all the images to these folders.
7.  - Move the video folders to wherever you would 
      like to store them.
-------------------------------------------------------



-------------------------------------------------------
Some errors you may encounter.
-------------------------------------------------------
- If the dirlist file already exists, it will quit so
  as not to overwrite it.
- If it finds a v### folder for a video that it is 
  expected to export, it will quit before creating 
  any v### folder.  So if it quits for this reason,
  the output directory should not have been changed.
